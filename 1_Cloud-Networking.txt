CLOUD-NETWORKING
1. What is a cloud computing?
	Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, 
	and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

2. What are all the services you are aware about cloud computing?
	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides access to virtual machines, storage, and networking resources.
	Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a development environment for building and deploying applications.
	Software as a Service (SaaS): Provides access to software applications over the internet.
	Function as a Service (FaaS): Provides a way to run code without having to worry about managing servers or infrastructure.

3. What is the major difference between server and serverless computing?
	Server computing: You are responsible for provisioning, configuring, and managing the servers. 
	This can be a time-consuming and complex task, especially if you need to scale your infrastructure as your needs change. 
	Serverless computing: The cloud provider takes care of all of this for you. 
	You simply write your code and deploy it to the cloud, and the cloud provider will run it when needed and scale it up or down as traffic demands.

4. Give an example for SAAS 
	Salesforce: A cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software.
	Dropbox: Cloud storage service
	Google Workspace: Suite of productivity apps
	Zoom: Video conferencing software
	Slack: Business communication platform
	Adobe Creative Cloud: Suite of creative apps

5. What is the major difference between Azure and AWS
	Azure: Developed by Microsoft, it is more focused on hybrid cloud and enterprise solutions.
	AWS: Developed by Amazon, it is more focused on IaaS and has a wider range of services.

6. Explain about the security with respect to cloud technology
	Data security: Protecting data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or destruction.
	Identity and access management: Controlling who has access to cloud resources and what they can do with them.
	Compliance: Ensuring that cloud computing operations comply with applicable laws and regulations.
	Disaster recovery: Protecting data and applications from outages and disasters.

7. What are the 3 types of deployment in cloud?
	Public cloud: Cloud services are provided by a third-party vendor and delivered over the internet.
	Private cloud: Cloud services are hosted on a private network and managed by the organization.
	Hybrid cloud: A combination of public and private clouds.

8. How a client and a server works?
	Client: Requests a service from the server. 
	Server: Responds to the client's request and provides the requested service.

9. How a partition occurs in the cloud?
	Partitioning is a technique used to improve the performance and scalability of cloud databases.
	By dividing a large dataset into smaller partitions, each partition can be processed independently.
	This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed by each query.
	It can also improve scalability by allowing the database to be scaled out by adding more partition

10. Explain the 5 significance of Cloud technology
	Cost savings: Cloud computing can help businesses save money on hardware, software, and IT staff.
	Scalability: Cloud computing can be scaled up or down as needed, so businesses can save money by only paying for the resources they use.
	Agility: Cloud computing can help businesses be more agile and responsive to change.
	Security: Cloud computing providers offer a variety of security features to protect businesses' data.
	Innovation: Cloud computing can help businesses innovate by providing access to new technologies and services.
