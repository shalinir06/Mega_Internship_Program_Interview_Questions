1.	What is a ETL ?
	ETL: Extract, Transform, and Load.
	ETL is a process that is used to extract data from one system (such as databases, data warehouses, and data lakes), 
	transform it into a different format (such as CSV, JSON, and XML), and load it into another system.

2.	List out the various tools used in ETL
	Informatica PowerCenter: A comprehensive ETL platform that can be used to extract, transform, and load data from a variety of sources.
	IBM InfoSphere DataStage: A popular ETL tool that offers a wide range of features, including data cleansing, data integration, and data quality.
	Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS): A powerful ETL tool that is included with Microsoft SQL Server.

3.	Draw the mechanism of ETL
	Extract: The data is extracted from the source system. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as querying a database, reading a file, 
	or extracting data from a web service.
	Transform: The data is transformed into a different format. This may involve cleaning the data, removing duplicate records, 
	or converting the data into a different format.
	Load: The data is loaded into the target system. This may involve creating a new table in a database, updating an existing table, 
	or loading the data into a data warehouse.

4.	What is a datalake
	Data lake: A centralized repository of raw data in its original format. This means that the data is not cleaned, transformed, or structured in any way.
	Stored: Unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.

5.	What is a data warehouse
	Data warehouse: A centralized repository of historical data. The data in a data warehouse is typically historical data that has been cleaned, 
	transformed, and organized in a way that makes it easy to query and analyze.
	Stored: For analysis and reporting.

6.	OLTP VS OLAP
	OLTP: Online transaction processing (OLTP) is a system that is used to process transactions in real-time. 
	OLTP systems are typically used for applications such as customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and e-commerce.
	OLAP: Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a system that is used to analyze data for insights. OLAP systems are typically used for applications 
	such as business intelligence (BI) and data mining.

7.	What are all the various analytical tools that can be connected with Datawarehouse?
	Business intelligence (BI) tools: BI tools are used to analyze data and generate reports.
	Data mining tools: Data mining tools are used to extract patterns and insights from data.
	Machine learning tools: Machine learning tools are used to build models that can predict future outcomes.
	Statistical analysis tools: Statistical analysis tools are used to calculate statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
	Visualization tools: Visualization tools are used to create charts and graphs that help to understand data.

8.	Explain the different stages used in ETL
	Extract: Extract data from the source system.
	Transform: Transform the data into a format that can be loaded into the target system.
	Load: Load the data into the target system.

9.	Explain 10 use cases for NOSQL
	Real-time big data: NoSQL databases are well-suited for real-time big data applications, such as social media analytics and fraud detection.
	Log data: NoSQL databases can be used to store and analyze log data, which can be used to troubleshoot problems and improve performance.
	Geospatial data: NoSQL databases can be used to store and analyze geospatial data, such as GPS data and street maps.
	Sensor data: NoSQL databases can be used to store and analyze sensor data, such as data from IoT devices.
	Document storage: NoSQL databases can be used to store and manage documents, such as PDFs and images.
	Content management: NoSQL databases can be used to store and manage content, such as blog posts and product descriptions.
	E-commerce: NoSQL databases can be used to store and manage e-commerce data, such as product catalogs and customer orders.
	Fraud detection: NoSQL databases can be used to store and analyze data to detect fraud.
	Personalization: NoSQL databases can be used to store and analyze data to personalize the user experience.
	IoT: NoSQL databases can be used to store and analyze data from IoT devices.

10.	What are all the characteristics of a nosql
	Schema-less: NoSQL databases do not require a predefined schema.
	Highly scalable: NoSQL databases can be scaled horizontally to handle large amounts of data.

11.	What are all the tools used to analyse nosql
	MongoDB Compass: A GUI tool for exploring and analyzing MongoDB databases.
	Elasticsearch: A search engine for analyzing large amounts of data.
	Apache Hadoop: A framework for storing and processing large amounts of data.
	Apache Spark: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
	Tableau: A business intelligence tool for visualizing data.
