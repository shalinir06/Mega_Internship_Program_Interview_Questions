DATA
1. How do you define a data and a meta data
	Data: Facts and statistics that can be used to describe or measure something.
	Metadata: Data about data. It describes the data and provides information about its structure, content, and context.

2. Diff between histogram and a bar chart
	Histogram: A graphical representation of the distribution of continuous data.
	Bar chart: A graphical representation of the distribution of categorical data.
	For example, a histogram could be used to represent the distribution of heights of people, 
	while a bar chart could be used to represent the distribution of favourite colors of people.

3. what are all the different types of categorical data
	Nominal data: Data that is used to name or classify things. The categories in nominal data are not ordered. 
	For example, the categories of eye color (blue, brown, green, hazel) are nominal data.
	Ordinal data: Data that has a natural order, but the order does not have a numerical meaning. 
	For example, the categories of a survey question (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) are ordinal data.

4. How do you diff quantitive and a qualitive data
	Quantitative data: 
	o	Data that can be measured and expressed as numbers. 
	o	It can be used to answer questions about how much, how many, or how often something happens. 
	o	For example, the number of students in a class, the average height of people in a country, or the number of times a website is visited 
		are all quantitative data.
	Qualitative data: 
	o	Data that cannot be measured and is expressed in words or descriptions.
	o	It can be used to answer questions about why, how, or what something is. 
	o	For example, the reasons why people choose to buy a particular product, the descriptions of people's experiences, 
		or the opinions of people on a particular topic are all qualitative data.

5. What are all the continuous datatypes you are aware of
	Float: A floating-point number with 32 bits of precision.
	Double: A floating-point number with 64 bits of precision.
	Decimal: A floating-point number with variable precision.

BIG DATA
1. What is a big data?
	Big data is a term used to describe data sets that are too large and complex to be analyzed using traditional data processing methods. 
	These datasets can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, and they can come from a variety of sources.

2. When you will coin the data as a bigdata
	When the data is too large, too complex, and too fast to be processed using traditional data processing methods.

3. Arrange the data from bits to bigdata based on their sizes
	Bits: The smallest unit of data.
	Big data: Very large datasets that are too complex and/or voluminous to be analyzed using traditional data processing methods. 
	Big data is typically measured in petabytes or exabytes. However, as the amount of data continues to grow, 
	it is likely that we will need to start using even larger units of measurement, such as zettabytes and yottabytes.
Here is a more detailed explanation of the different data sizes:
	Bits: A bit is the smallest unit of data. It can have two values: 0 or 1.
	Bytes: A byte is a group of 8 bits. It can represent 256 different values.
	Kilobyte (KB): A kilobyte is a group of 1024 bytes.
	Megabyte (MB): A megabyte is a group of 1024 kilobytes.
	Gigabyte (GB): A gigabyte is a group of 1024 megabytes.
	Terabyte (TB): A terabyte is a group of 1024 gigabytes.
	Petabyte (PB): A petabyte is a group of 1024 terabytes.
	Exabyte (EB): An exabyte is a group of 1024 petabytes.
	Zettabyte (ZB): A zettabyte is a group of 1024 exabytes.
	Yottabyte (YB): A yottabyte is a group of 1024 zettabytes.

4. Arrange the tiny into to long int based on their byte size
	Tiny: 1 byte
	Short: 2 bytes
	Int: 4 bytes
	Long: 4 bytes (on 32-bit systems) or 8 bytes (on 64-bit systems)
	Long long: 8 bytes

5. Difference between char and varchar
	CHAR: A CHAR data type is a fixed-length character string data type. This means that the string must always be the same length, 
	even if the actual data is shorter. For example, a CHAR (10) data type would always be 10 characters long, even if the actual data is only 5 characters long.
	VARCHAR: A VARCHAR data type is a variable-length character string data type. This means that the string can be any length, 
	up to the maximum length of the data type. For example, a VARCHAR (10) data type can be anywhere from 1 to 10 characters long.


6. Difference between double and float explain with an example
	Float: A float is a floating-point number with 32 bits of precision. This means that it can represent a number with up to 7 decimal places of accuracy. 
	For example, the float value 3.1415923 can be represented exactly, but the float value 1.2345678901234567 cannot be represented exactly.
	Double: A double is a floating-point number with 64 bits of precision. This means that it can represent a number with up to 15 decimal places of accuracy. 
	For example, the double value 3.141592653589793 can be represented exactly.

7. Arrange the datypes based on their byte size (char,float,decimal,double,boolean,int,date,time)
	Boolean: 1 byte
	Char: 1 byte
	Short: 2 bytes
	Int: 4 bytes
	Long: 4 bytes (on 32-bit systems) or 8 bytes (on 64-bit systems)
	Long long: 8 bytes
	Float: 4 bytes
	Double: 8 bytes
	Decimal: Varies (Some implementations use 8 bytes, while others use 16 bytes.)
	Date: Varies (Some implementations use 4 bytes, while others use 8 bytes.)
	Time: Varies (Some implementations use 4 bytes, while others use 8 bytes.)


8. Difference between date and timestamp
	Date: A date data type represents a specific date. It can be represented in a variety of formats, such as YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY, or MM/DD/YYYY.
	Timestamp: A timestamp data type represents a date and time. It can be represented in a variety of formats, 
	such as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS, or MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS.

9. What are ordinal and nominal data
	Ordinal data has a natural order, but the order does not have a numerical meaning. 
	For example, the categories of a survey question (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) are ordinal data.
	Nominal data is data that is used to name or classify things. The categories in nominal data are not ordered. 
	For example, the categories of eye color (blue, brown, green, hazel) are nominal data.
