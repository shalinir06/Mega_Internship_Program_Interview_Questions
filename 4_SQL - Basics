1. What is a RDBMS
	A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a software system designed to manage data in a relational database.
	A relational database is a database that stores data in tables. Each table consists of rows and columns. The rows represent records, 
	and the columns represent the fields in each record.

2. SQL VS SQL server
	SQL: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language used to manage data in a relational database. SQL statements are used to create, update, and delete data in a database. SQL can also be used to query data in a database.
	SQL Server: SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL. 
	It is a commercial product developed by Microsoft. SQL Server is one of the most popular RDBMSs in the world

3. What are all the properties of a sql?
	Relational: SQL is a relational language, which means that it is designed to work with data that is stored in tables.
	Declarative: SQL is a declarative language, which means that it specifies what data you want to retrieve, not how to retrieve it.
	Procedural: SQL is also a procedural language, which means that it allows you to write code that performs specific tasks.

4. Explain any 3 different databases you know?
	MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle Corporation. MySQL is used by a wide variety of applications, 
	including websites, e-commerce applications, and enterprise applications.
	PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group. 
	It is a powerful and versatile RDBMS that is used by a wide variety of applications, including websites, e-commerce applications, and enterprise applications.
	MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL document database developed by MongoDB, Inc. It is a non-relational database that stores data in JSON-like documents

5. When to adopt sql database?
	Your data is relational. 
	You need to scale your database.
	You need to work with a variety of data types. 
	You are familiar with SQL.


6. List out the 4 important points about Primary Key (PK)
	Unique: A primary key must be unique for each row in a table. This means that no two rows can have the same value in the primary key column.
	Not Null: A primary key cannot be null. This means that every row in a table must have a value in the primary key column.
	It can be used to create indexes, which can improve the performance of queries.
	Consistent: The value in the primary key column must always be consistent. This means that the value cannot change once it is assigned to a row.

7. Diff DDL VS DML
	DDL: DDL statements are used to define the structure of a database. They are used to create new tables, add columns to existing tables, rename, 
	truncate delete the complete data from the table without deleting the table structure, and drop tables. DDL statements are also used to create views, 
	which are virtual tables that are based on existing tables. DDL commands are auto-committed
	DML: DML statements are used to manipulate the data in a database. They are used to insert new data into tables, update existing data in tables, 
	delete data from tables, and select data from tables. DML statements can also be used to perform calculations on data and to sort and group data.  
	DML commands are not auto-committed

8. ACID property of a database
	ACID: A set of properties that guarantee the integrity of data in a database.
	Atomicity: A transaction is either completely successful or completely unsuccessful. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
	Consistency: The database remains in a consistent state at all times. This means that the data in the database always reflects the real world.
	Isolation: Transactions are isolated from each other. This means that the changes made by one transaction do not affect other transactions that are running 
	at the same time.
	Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent. This means that the changes cannot be lost even if the database crashes.

9. Diff Unique and primary key
	Unique key: A unique key is a column (or a combination of columns) in a table that cannot have duplicate values. 
	However, a unique key does not have to be the primary key of the table.
	Primary key: A primary key is a column (or a combination of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. 
	A primary key cannot have duplicate values and cannot be null.

10. Truncate is DDL or DML
	TRUNCATE is a DDL(Data Definition Language) command and is used to delete all the rows or tuples from a table. 
	Unlike the DELETE command, the TRUNCATE command does not contain a WHERE clause. 
	In the TRUNCATE command, the transaction log for each deleted data page is not recorded. The TRUNCATE command is fast. 
	We cannot roll back the data after using the TRUNCATE command.

11. What is mean by Foreign key and its uses
	A foreign key is a column (or a combination of columns) in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. 
	Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity between tables. Referential integrity is a set of rules that ensures that the data in 
	one table is consistent with the data in another table.

12. What are the different constraints in SQL and explain
	Primary key constraint: A primary key constraint is a column (or a combination of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. 
	A primary key constraint cannot have duplicate values and cannot be null.
	Unique constraint: A unique constraint is a column (or a combination of columns) in a table that cannot have duplicate values. 
	However, a unique constraint does not have to be the primary key of the table.
	Foreign key constraint: A foreign key constraint is a column (or a combination of columns) in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. 
	Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity between tables.
	Check constraint: A check constraint is a constraint that specifies a condition that the values in a column must satisfy. 
	For example, a check constraint could specify that the values in a salary column must be greater than or equal to 0.
	Not null constraint: A not null constraint specifies that a column cannot have a null value.
	Default constraint: A default constraint specifies a default value that is used for a column if no value is specified.

13. Diff between char and varchar
	CHAR: A CHAR data type is a fixed-length character string. This means that the column always takes up the same amount of space, 
	regardless of the length of the string that is stored in it.
	VARCHAR: A VARCHAR data type is a variable-length character string. This means that the column can store strings of different lengths, 
	up to a maximum length that is specified when the column is created

14. Diff between float, double and decimal
	Float: A float data type is a floating-point number. This means that the number can have a decimal point and a fractional part. 
	The precision of a float number is limited, which means that it cannot store very large or very small numbers accurately.
	Double: A double data type is also a floating-point number. However, it has a higher precision than a float number, which means that it can store very large 
	or very small numbers more accurately.
	Decimal: A decimal data type is a fixed-point number. This means that the number has a fixed number of digits to the right of the decimal point. 
	The precision of a decimal number is higher than that of a float or double number, which means that it can store very precise numbers
