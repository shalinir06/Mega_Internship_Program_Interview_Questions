1. What are windows function?
	Window functions are functions that operate on a window of rows, rather than on the entire result set.
	Window functions are often used to calculate moving averages, cumulative sums, and other statistical measures.

2. What are CTE?
	CTEs (Common Table Expressions) are temporary named tables created within a query.
	CTEs can be used to improve the readability and performance of queries.

3. How to identify duplicates?
	Use the DISTINCT keyword.
	The DISTINCT keyword returns only unique values in a column.

4. Use case of Row_num()
	ROW_NUM() assigns a sequential number to each row in the result set.
	It is useful for ranking rows or for displaying a sequential number for each row.

5. How row_id differes from row_num()
	ROW_ID(): The ROW_ID() function returns the unique identifier for each row in the result set.
	ROW_NUM(): The ROW_NUM() function assigns a sequential number to each row in the result set.

6. Where to use partition?
	The PARTITION BY clause is used to divide the result set into partitions before applying aggregate functions or window functions.
	This can improve the performance of queries by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.

7. Difference between a table and a CTE
	A table is a permanent data structure, while a CTE is a temporary data structure.
	A table is stored in the database, while a CTE is created and destroyed within a query.


8. Difference between a rank and dense rank function give a use case
	RANK() function assigns ranks to rows within a window, skipping ranks for duplicate values.
	DENSE_RANK() function assigns ranks to rows within a window, without skipping ranks for duplicate values.


9. When to use a lag and led function
	LAG(): The LAG() function returns the value of a column in the previous row.
	LEAD(): The LEAD() function returns the value of a column in the next row.
